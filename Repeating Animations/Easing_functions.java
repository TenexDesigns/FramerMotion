Framer Motion provides various types of easing functions that you can use to control the acceleration and deceleration of animations. Easing functions define the rate of change of a property over time, which can affect the visual appearance of an animation. Here are some common easing types available in Framer Motion:

1. **linear**:
   - Linear easing means that the animation progresses at a constant speed throughout its duration. It creates a consistent motion without any acceleration or deceleration.

   ```jsx
   transition={{ type: 'linear', duration: 1 }}
   ```

2. **easeIn**:
   - Ease-in easing starts the animation slowly and accelerates as it progresses. It gives a gradual increase in speed.

   ```jsx
   transition={{ type: 'easeIn', duration: 1 }}
   ```

3. **easeOut**:
   - Ease-out easing starts the animation quickly and decelerates as it progresses. It begins with a fast motion and slows down towards the end.

   ```jsx
   transition={{ type: 'easeOut', duration: 1 }}
   ```

4. **easeInOut**:
   - Ease-in-out easing combines both ease-in and ease-out effects. It starts slow, accelerates in the middle, and then slows down again at the end.

   ```jsx
   transition={{ type: 'easeInOut', duration: 1 }}
   ```

5. **easeOutBack**:
   - Ease-out-back easing creates a slight overshoot effect at the end of the animation, which can add a bounce or elastic feel to the motion.

   ```jsx
   transition={{ type: 'easeOutBack', duration: 1 }}
   ```

6. **easeInOutBack**:
   - Ease-in-out-back combines ease-in-out with a slight overshoot at both the beginning and the end of the animation.

   ```jsx
   transition={{ type: 'easeInOutBack', duration: 1 }}
   ```

7. **spring**:
   - Spring easing simulates a spring-like effect, which can be useful for creating more natural and bouncy animations. You can specify additional spring properties like `stiffness` and `damping` with this easing type.

   ```jsx
   transition={{ type: 'spring', stiffness: 200, damping: 20 }}
   ```

8. **custom**:
   - Custom easing allows you to define your own cubic bezier curve for precise control over the animation's timing function.

   ```jsx
   transition={{ type: 'custom', ease: [0.42, 0, 0.58, 1] }}
   ```

You can choose the easing type that best fits your desired animation effect. Experimenting with different easing functions can help you achieve the look and feel you want for your animations in Framer Motion.
