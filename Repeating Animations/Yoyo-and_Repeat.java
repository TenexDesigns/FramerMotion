In Framer Motion, both "yoyo" and "repeat" are properties used to control the behavior of animations, but they serve different purposes:

1. **Yoyo**:
   - `yoyo` is used to create a ping-pong effect in animations. When you set `yoyo` to `true`, it means that the animation will play forward (from the initial state to the animate state) and then backward (from the animate state back to the initial state).
   - This property is often used to create animations that go back and forth, such as a text element moving back and forth horizontally.

   Example:
   ```jsx
   <motion.div
     animate={{ x: 100 }}
     transition={{ duration: 1, yoyo: Infinity }}
   >
     Ping-Pong Animation
   </motion.div>
   ```
   In this example, the `yoyo` property is set to `Infinity`, so the animation will keep ping-ponging indefinitely.

2. **Repeat**:
   - `repeat` is used to specify how many times an animation should repeat. You can set it to a number to determine the exact number of repetitions, or you can use `"Infinity"` to make the animation repeat indefinitely.
   - Unlike `yoyo`, `repeat` doesn't create a ping-pong effect. It simply repeats the animation from the initial state to the animate state the specified number of times.

   Example:
   ```jsx
   <motion.div
     animate={{ x: 100 }}
     transition={{ duration: 1, repeat: 3 }}
   >
     Repeating Animation (3 times)
   </motion.div>
   ```
   In this example, the animation will repeat three times.

To summarize:

- **Yoyo** creates a back-and-forth animation effect, where the animation plays forward and then backward in a continuous loop.
- **Repeat** specifies how many times the animation should repeat in a unidirectional manner (from initial to animate state).

You can also combine both properties to create complex animations. For example, you can use `yoyo` with `repeat` to make an animation ping-pong a certain number of times.

```jsx
<motion.div
  animate={{ x: 100 }}
  transition={{ duration: 1, yoyo: true, repeat: 3 }}
>
  Ping-Pong Animation (3 times)
</motion.div>
```

In this example, the animation will ping-pong three times, creating a back-and-forth effect, and then stop.
