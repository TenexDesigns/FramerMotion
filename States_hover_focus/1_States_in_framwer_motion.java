Framer Motion provides several states that you can animate to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces. Some of the common states include `hover`, `focus`, `tap`, and `whileTap`. However, there are more states and events you can leverage in Framer Motion. Here's a list of some key states and events along with examples of how to animate them in a Next.js app with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion:

1. **hover**:
   - The `hover` state is triggered when the user's mouse pointer hovers over an element. You can use it to create hover animations.

   ```jsx
   <motion.button whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}>Hover Me</motion.button>
   ```

2. **focus**:
   - The `focus` state is triggered when an element receives focus, typically via keyboard navigation. You can use it for focus-related animations, such as input fields.

   ```jsx
   <motion.input whileFocus={{ borderColor: 'green' }} />
   ```

3. **tap**:
   - The `tap` state is triggered when the user clicks or taps an element. You can use it for click or tap animations.

   ```jsx
   <motion.div whileTap={{ scale: 0.9 }}>Click Me</motion.div>
   ```

4. **whileTap**:
   - The `whileTap` state allows you to define animations that play while the element is being tapped or clicked.

   ```jsx
   <motion.button whileTap={{ scale: 0.9 }}>Tap Me</motion.button>
   ```

5. **whileHover**:
   - The `whileHover` state defines animations that play while the mouse pointer is hovering over an element.

   ```jsx
   <motion.div whileHover={{ rotate: 90 }}>Hover Me</motion.div>
   ```

6. **whileFocus**:
   - The `whileFocus` state defines animations that play while an element has focus (typically for form elements).

   ```jsx
   <motion.input whileFocus={{ scale: 1.1 }} />
   ```

7. **whileDrag**:
   - The `whileDrag` state allows you to animate elements while they are being dragged. Useful for drag-and-drop interfaces.

   ```jsx
   <motion.div whileDrag={{ opacity: 0.7 }}>Drag Me</motion.div>
   ```

8. **whilePageScroll**:
   - The `whilePageScroll` state is triggered when the page is scrolled. You can use it to create scroll-triggered animations.

   ```jsx
   <motion.div whilePageScroll={{ opacity: 0 }}>Fade In on Scroll</motion.div>
   ```

9. **whilePan**:
   - The `whilePan` state is triggered during pan gestures (e.g., dragging on touch devices).

   ```jsx
   <motion.div whilePan={{ scale: 1.2 }}>Pan Me</motion.div>
   ```

10. **whileDragConstraints**:
    - The `whileDragConstraints` state allows you to specify constraints for draggable elements.

    ```jsx
    <motion.div whileDragConstraints={{ left: 0, right: 200 }}>Drag Horizontally</motion.div>
    ```

These are just a few examples of the states and events available in Framer Motion. You can use these states to create interactive animations in your Next.js app with Tailwind CSS. The key is to wrap your components in the `<motion>` component and apply the desired animation variants based on the state or event you want to trigger the animation.
