In Tailwind CSS, variants are used to define the different states or conditions in which a utility class should be generated. Variants allow you to control which utility classes are generated based on factors such as responsiveness, interaction states, or custom conditions. They provide a way to customize the behavior and appearance of your components based on different contexts.

Here's how you can use variants in Tailwind CSS with Next.js and Framer Motion:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   - Tailwind CSS: Follow the installation instructions in the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).
   - Next.js: Set up a new Next.js project by following the [official Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).
   - Framer Motion: Install Framer Motion by running the following command in your project directory:
     ```
     npm install framer-motion
     ```

2. Configure Tailwind CSS variants:
   - In your `tailwind.config.js` file, define the variants you want to use for specific utility classes. You can use variants like `responsive`, `hover`, `focus`, and more. For example:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       variants: {
         backgroundColor: ['responsive', 'hover', 'focus'],
         borderColor: ['responsive', 'hover', 'focus'],
       },
     }
     ```
     This configuration will generate utility classes for `backgroundColor` and `borderColor` with variants for responsiveness, hover, and focus.
   
   - You can also create custom variants using the `before` and `after` helper functions. These allow you to add new variants before or after the default variants of a plugin. Here's an example:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       variants: {
         backgroundColor: ({ before }) => before(['active']),
       },
     }
     ```
     This configuration adds the `active` variant before the default variants for the `backgroundColor` plugin.
   
   - The `variants` helper function can be used to retrieve the variants for a specific plugin. This can be useful if you need to read or manipulate the variants directly. Here's an example:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       variants: {
         backgroundColor: ({ variants }) => [...variants('backgroundColor'), 'active'],
       },
     }
     ```
     This configuration retrieves the variants for the `backgroundColor` plugin and adds the `active` variant to the list.
   
   - Additionally, Tailwind CSS provides the special `default` variant, which controls where the normal, non-prefixed versions of a utility are generated relative to the other variants. Here's an example:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       variants: {
         backgroundColor: ['hover', 'default', 'focus'],
       },
     }
     ```
     This configuration generates normal, hover, and focus variants for the `backgroundColor` utility, with the normal variant placed between the hover and focus variants.

3. Use variants in your components:
   - In your Next.js components, you can apply utility classes with different variants to achieve specific effects or behaviors. For example, to apply a background color that changes on hover, you can use the `hover` variant:
     ```jsx
     import React from 'react';
     import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';
     
     const MyComponent = () => {
       return (
         <div className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-red-500">
           This div has a blue background color that changes to red on hover.
         </div>
       );
     };
     
     export default MyComponent;
     ```
     In this example, the `bg-blue-500` class applies a blue background color by default, and the `hover:bg-red-500` class changes the background color to red on hover.
   
   - You can combine multiple variants to create more complex interactions. For example, to apply a different background color on hover and focus, you can use both the `hover` and `focus` variants:
     ```jsx
     import React from 'react';
     import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';
     
     const MyComponent = () => {
       return (
         <input className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-red-500 focus:bg-green-500" type="text" />
       );
     };
     
     export default MyComponent;
     ```
     In this example, the `bg-blue-500` class applies a blue background color by default, the `hover:bg-red-500` class changes the background color to red on hover, and the `focus:bg-green-500` class changes the background color to green when the input is focused.
   
   - With Framer Motion, you can animate the properties of elements using the `animate` prop. You can use variants to define different animation states and apply them to elements. Here's an example:
     ```jsx
     import React from 'react';
     import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
     import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css
