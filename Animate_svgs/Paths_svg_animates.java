Sure, here are some code samples for animating the paths for an SVG in a Tailwind and Next.js application using Framer Motion:

* **Animating the path of an SVG from a circle to a square:**

```jsx
const animation = motion.svg(
  <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
    <path d="M50 50" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" />
  </svg>,
  {
    d: {
      from: "M50 50",
      to: "M0 0 L100 0 L100 100 L0 100 L0 0",
      tween: "linear",
      duration: 1000,
    },
  },
);
```

* **Animating the path of an SVG using a spring animation:**

```jsx
const animation = motion.spring(
  <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
    <path d="M50 50" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" />
  </svg>,
  {
    d: {
      from: "M50 50",
      to: "M0 0 L100 0 L100 100 L0 100 L0 0",
      stiffness: 100,
      damping: 10,
    },
  },
);
```

* **Animating the path of an SVG with multiple steps:**

```jsx
const animation = motion.svg(
  <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
    <path d="M50 50" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" />
  </svg>,
  {
    d: {
      steps: [
        { from: "M50 50", to: "M0 0" },
        { from: "M0 0", to: "M100 0" },
        { from: "M100 0", to: "M100 100" },
        { from: "M100 100", to: "M0 100" },
        { from: "M0 100", to: "M0 0" },
      ],
      tween: "linear",
      duration: 1000,
    },
  },
);
```

* **Animating the path of an SVG with a callback function:**

```jsx
const animation = motion.svg(
  <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
    <path d="M50 50" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" />
  </svg>,
  {
    d: {
      from: "M50 50",
      to: "M0 0",
      onUpdate: () => {
        console.log("The path has been updated");
      },
      tween: "linear",
      duration: 1000,
    },
  },
);
```

I hope this helps!
