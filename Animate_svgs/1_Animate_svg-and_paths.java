Animating SVG paths in a Tailwind CSS and Next.js application using Framer Motion involves targeting the individual path elements within your SVG and animating their properties. Here's an example of how to animate SVG paths using Framer Motion:

1. **Create a Component**:
   Create a React component that includes an SVG with path elements you want to animate:

   ```jsx
   // components/AnimatedSVGPaths.js

   import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

   function AnimatedSVGPaths() {
     return (
       <motion.svg
         xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
         width="100"
         height="100"
         viewBox="0 0 100 100"
       >
         <motion.path
           d="M10 50 C 40 10, 65 10, 95 50 Z"
           fill="blue"
           initial={{ pathLength: 0, opacity: 0 }}
           animate={{ pathLength: 1, opacity: 1 }}
           transition={{ duration: 2 }}
         />
       </motion.svg>
     );
   }

   export default AnimatedSVGPaths;
   ```

   In this example, we've created an `AnimatedSVGPaths` component that contains an SVG with a path element inside. We're using Framer Motion to animate the `pathLength` property and the `opacity` of the path element.

2. **Use the Component**:
   Use the `AnimatedSVGPaths` component within your Next.js application:

   ```jsx
   // pages/index.js

   import AnimatedSVGPaths from '../components/AnimatedSVGPaths';

   function Home() {
     return (
       <div className="flex justify-center items-center h-screen">
         <AnimatedSVGPaths />
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default Home;
   ```

3. **Run Your Application**:
   Run your Next.js application to see the animated SVG path in action:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   When you navigate to the homepage, you should see the path element animate its `pathLength` and opacity properties, which can create interesting effects like drawing lines or fading in elements.

You can apply more complex animations to SVG paths by animating various path-related properties, such as `d` (the path data), `stroke`, `strokeWidth`, and others. Framer Motion allows you to create dynamic and engaging animations for your SVGs in your Tailwind CSS and Next.js application.
