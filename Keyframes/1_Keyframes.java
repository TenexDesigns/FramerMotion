Framer Motion allows you to create complex animations with keyframes, defining multiple animation steps between
  the `initial` and `animate` states. Keyframes can be used to achieve precise and customized animations for various properties.
  Here's how to use keyframes in Framer Motion with a Next.js app and Tailwind CSS, along with code samples:

**Step 1: Define Keyframes**
Start by defining keyframes for the animation. Keyframes consist of multiple animation steps, and each step defines the properties of the component at a specific point
  in time.

```jsx
const customKeyframes = {
  start: { opacity: 0, scale: 0 },
  middle: { opacity: 0.5, scale: 0.8 },
  end: { opacity: 1, scale: 1 },
};
```

In this example, we've defined three keyframes: "start," "middle," and "end." Each keyframe specifies different values for the `opacity` and `scale` properties.

**Step 2: Apply Keyframes to Components**
Apply the defined keyframes to the component you want to animate. You can use the `variants` property to specify the keyframes for the animation.

```jsx
<motion.div
  className="bg-blue-500 p-4 rounded-lg text-white"
  variants={customKeyframes}
  initial="start"
  animate="end"
  transition={{ duration: 2 }}
>
  Animate using Keyframes
</motion.div>
```

In this code, we've applied the `customKeyframes` to a `motion.div` element. We've specified that the animation should start with the "start" keyframe 
    and end with the "end" keyframe. The `transition` prop sets the duration of the animation.

**Step 3: Import Components and Framer Motion**
Ensure you import the necessary components and hooks from Framer Motion at the top of your file.

```jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
```

**Step 4: Run Your Next.js App**
Run your Next.js app using the appropriate command (e.g., `npm run dev`) to see the keyframe animation in action.

What Keyframes Do:
- Keyframes allow you to define intermediate animation steps between the `initial` and `animate` states.
- They enable you to create precise and customized animations with fine control over properties at each step.

How to Use Keyframes:
1. Define the keyframes object with multiple animation steps.
2. Apply the keyframes to the component using the `variants` property.
3. Specify the initial and animate states, transitioning between the keyframes.
4. Customize the animation duration and other transition properties as needed.

In the code sample provided, we've created a simple keyframe animation that changes the `opacity` and `scale` properties of a `motion.div` component. You can expand on this concept to create more complex animations with multiple keyframes and properties as required by your design.
